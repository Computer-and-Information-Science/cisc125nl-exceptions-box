# Exceptions - Shut The Box

The is an implementation of the *Box* class for part 1 of the *Shut The Box*
project. You may look to this implementation for modifications to your *Box*
class for part 2 of the project, however it is given here for an exercise
in using the exception mechanism.

For this exercise we will:

- Add exception classes to indicate various errors that my occur while closing tiles
- Change the *close* method such that it returns the score of the box instead of *bool*
- Modify the test program (*main* function) to detect errors base on exceptions
